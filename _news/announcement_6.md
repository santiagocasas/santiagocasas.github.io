I have given the plenary talk on behalf of the whole Cosmological Theory Working Group of the Euclid Consortium at
the EC annual meeting in Rome.
[Euclid Consortium website](https://www.euclid-ec.org/consortium/about-ec/)
Summarizing and highlighting the amazing science that will be possible with Euclid's unprecedented data!
I will post the slides on this website soon!
