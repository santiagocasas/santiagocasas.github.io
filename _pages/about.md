I am a cosmologist and theoretical physicist with a varied cultural background. Born in Colombia and raised in Costa Rica under a German culture and education.
Though I miss the sun :sunny:, the beach :palm_tree: and the deep green of Costa Rica's vegetation :turtle:, I have been living in Europe for more than 12 years already :snowflake:.

My research interests consist broadly on unveiling the mysteries of the Dark Universe using cosmological observables and computational statistical techniques. Currently, I am spending most of my time in preparing the data analysis and the theoretical modelling for the [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) space telescope mission :rocket:. I am also a member of the science working group of the [SKAO](https://www.skao.int/en/news) radio observatory.

I did my Bachelor in Physics at the [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr), my Master in Physics (with emphasis in Theoretical Physics) at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) and I stayed in the same city at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/) for my PhD studies under the supervision of Prof. Luca Amendola and Prof. Valeria Pettorino.

In my free time, I like to contribute back to my home region by being part of the [**Alpha-Cen**](https://astro.alphacen.org/en/) network, which is a non-profit and non-governmental scientific group created for the development and strengthening of research in astronomical sciences in Central America and the Caribbean. 

I am also very interested in reading about Macroeconomics, Blockchain, Digital Currencies and if I'm not doing that, then you can find me in the next Karaoke bar or at home listening to good music, while I try to remember the days when I was a trumpet player. I am a great fan of photography and sometimes post on instagram pretty pictures taken with my Nikon DSLR or some old analog camera.
